# kubernetes-deploy 0.31.1 -> krane 1.0.0 migration guide

**THIS MIGRATION GUIDE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THINGS CAN STILL CHANGE BEFORE 1.0.0**

`kubernetes-deploy` was renamed `krane` when version 1.0.0 was released. Version 1.0.0 introduced [new features and breaking changes](CHANGELOG.md). This guide will help you transition to version 1.0.0 as smoothly as possible.

**TL;DR**:
* The command-line interface was redesigned; alongside the name change there are breaking changes in several flags.
* There are breaking changes in the public API (such as the renaming of the `KubernetesDeploy` namespace to `Krane`, and the change in default values for different arguments of the public interface).
* StatsD metrics will now be generated with the `krane` prefix.
* `kubernetes-deploy` (now `krane deploy`) / `DeployTask` can no longer deploy global (non-namespaced) resources. A new command called `krane global-deploy` and a related class called `GlobalDeployTask` were added to replace that feature.
* If you attempt to install two gems that have conflicting executables, `gem install` will warn you but the most recently installed one will win.

## Public API changes

The only breaking change in the public API (so far) is the renaming of the `KubernetesDeploy` namespace to `Krane`. Otherwise, the APIs of the major public classes (`DeployTask`, `RenderTask`, `RunnerTask`, and `RestartTask`) have not changed between 0.31.1 and 1.0.0. If you're curious about this API, check the comment-based docs on these classes or the [rendered documentation at RubyGems.org](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/kubernetes-deploy/1.0.0/KubernetesDeploy/DeployTask).

## Command-line interface changes

Old command | New command
--- | ---
`kubernetes-deploy` | `krane deploy`
`kubernetes-deploy -v` | `krane version`
`kubernetes-render` | `krane render`
`kubernetes-run` | `krane run`
`kubernetes-restart` | `krane restart`
`[kubernetes-deploy with global resources in templates]` | `krane global-deploy`

### Flag changes

The following tables provide a mapping of the flags previously supported in `kubernetes-deploy` and their new version in `krane` (if applicable).

Important: you can't repeat flags. If you need to provide multiple arguments for a flag, use a space-separated list (e.g. `-f file1.yml file2.yml`) unless specified otherwise.

#### krane deploy

Old flag | New flag | Comments
--- | --- | ---
--bindings=BINDINGS | --bindings=BINDINGS |
--skip-wait | --verify-result=true |
--allow-protected-ns | --protected-namespaces=default,kube-system,kube-public | Added the ability to specify which namespaces are protected
--no-prune | --prune=true |
--template-dir | -f, --filename | Makes all krane commands accept this argument, which is now required for the deploy task
--verbose-log-prefix | --verbose-log-prefix |
--max-watch-seconds=seconds | --global-timeout=300s | Changed flag name and default value to be a duration (expressed using strings like "300s" or "1h")
--selector | --selector |
-h, --help | -h, --help |
-v, --version | [none] | Replaced with `krane version`
$ENVIRONMENT | [none] | Dropped in favour of `-f`
$REVISION | --current-sha | The environment variable REVISION was dropped in favour of an explicit flag
[none] | --render-erb | **Important:** the new CLI doesn't render ERB by default

#### krane restart

Old flag | New flag | Comments
--- | --- | ---
--deployments=LIST | --deployments=LIST |
--max-watch-seconds=seconds | --global-timeout=300s | Changed flag name and default value to be a duration (expressed using strings like "300s" or "1h")
[none] | --verify-result=true | Defines whether it should wait for results or exit immediately after validation

#### krane run

Old flag | New flag | Comments
--- | --- | ---
--skip-wait | --verify-result=true |
--max-watch-seconds=seconds | --global-timeout=300s | Changed flag name and default value to be a duration (expressed using strings like "300s" or "1h")
--entrypoint | --command | Changed flag name to make its purpose clearer
--template | --template | Changed to be required
[it is positional now] | --arguments | Optional flag, as `command` or the template might already specify the required arguments
--env-vars=ENV_VARS | --env-vars=ENV_VARS |

#### krane render

Old flag | New flag | Comments
--- | --- | ---
--bindings=BINDINGS | --bindings=BINDINGS |
--template-dir | -f, --filename | Changed to be more aligned with `kubectl apply` and other krane tasks
$REVISION | --current-sha | The environment variable REVISION was dropped in favour of an explicit flag

## Running `kubernetes-deploy` and `krane` side by side

If you attempt to install two gems that have conflicting executables (as is the case here), `gem install` will warn you but the most recently installed one will win. This means that you can run both `kubernetes-deploy` 0.31.1 and `krane` 1.0.0 side by side by doing:

```bash
gem install kubernetes-deploy -v 0.31.1
gem install -f krane -v 1.0.0
```

This can help you incrementally port scripts that use the old CLI to the new one.

## New task: `krane global-deploy`

`krane global-deploy` (accessible through the Ruby API as `Krane::GlobalDeployTask`) can deploy global (non-namespaced) resources such as `PersistentVolume`, `Namespace`, and `CustomResourceDefinition`. Its interface is very similar to `krane deploy`. Example usage:

```bash
$ cat my-template.yml
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: testing-storage-class
      labels:
        app: krane
    provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
$ krane global-deploy my-k8s-context -f my-template.yml --selector app=krane
```
